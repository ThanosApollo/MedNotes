* 1. Introduction - History and Subject
*** Microbiology is the study of microbes
+ Microbes are the living organisms
+ Require visualization through microscopy
*** Microbes are divided into :
+ *Viruses*
  + RNA or DNA
  + Double stranded or single stranded
+ *Bacteria*
  + Gram positive or gram negative
  + Shape(e.g cocci, bacillus)
+ *Fungi*
  + yeast(unicellular)
  + mold(multicellular)
  + dimorphic(yeast and mold)
+ *Parasites*
  + Protozoa
  + Worms
  + Bugs
*** History
+ Primitive cells evolved into bacteria and archae
+ Utilized photosynthesis which led to production of oxygen
+ As oxygen levels rose, organisms that utilized oxygen evolved(Aerobes and Eukaryotes)
+ Anaerobes developed resistance to oxygen, as it was toxic to them
+ *Endosymbiotic theory*
  + A prokaryotic cell engulfed an aerobe cell, capable of producing ATP
  + Host cell provided a stable environment, engulfed cell provided host cell with ATP, this lead to a *symbiotic relationship*
  + The bacterium eventually evolved mitochondria - Prokaryotes -> Eukaryotes
* 2. Bacterial Taxonomy - Classification, Nomeclatures, Identification
*** Classification
+ Categorization of organisms into taxonomic groups
+ Requires experimental and observational techniques
  + Biochemical, physiologic, genetic and morphologic properties are necessary for a taxon description
*** Nomeclature
+ Naming of the organism by international rules, according to it's characteristics
  + First word(Genus) is always capitalized
  + Second word(Species) is not capitalized
    /e.g Escherichia Coli/
*** Identification
+ Practical use of classification scheme to:
  + Isolated and distinguish desirable organism
  + Verify the authenticity or special properties of a culture
  + *Isolated and identify causative agent of disease*

**** Taxonomic ranks
+ Form the basis for the organization of bacteria, Linnaean taxonomy uses formal taxonomic tanks.
| Formal Rank | Example                 |
|-------------+-------------------------|
| Kingdom     | Prokaryotes             |
| Divison     | Gracilicutes            |
| Class       | Scotobacteria           |
| Order       | Eubacteriaceae          |
| Family      | Enterobacteriaceae      |
| Genus       | Escherichia             |
| Species     | Coli                    |
| Subtype     | Escherichia coli O157:7 |

/Traditionally, all living objects had been divided into plant and animla kingdom. There are some organisms that do not fulfil criteria for either of the two kingdoms. A new kingdom *Protista* was created to include these organisms. Protista has been divided into Viruses, Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes./
* 3. Bacterial Morphology
*** Shapes
+ Bacteria can have either of the three shapes
  + Cocci /e.g S.Aureus/
  + Bacilli(rods) /e.g Pseudomonas Aeruginosa/
  + Spirochets /e.g Borrelia/
*** Cell wall / Gram stain
+ Chemically formed by N-acetyl glucosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid molecules alternating in chains, /which are cross linked by peptide chains/
+ Bacteria are classified as /gram positive/ or /gram negative/ depending on their cell wall characteristics
| *Gram Positive*                                            | *Gram Negative*                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Comprise of 2 layers:                                      | Comprise of 3 layers:                                                                  |
| > Inner cytoplasmic membrane                               | > Inner cytoplasmic membrane                                                           |
| > Outer(thick and multilayred) peptidoglycan layer         | > A thin(single layer) peptidoglycan layer                                             |
|                                                            | > An outer membrane containing LPS-Lipopolysaccharide(Endotoxins)                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Thick peptidoglycan wall, traps crystal violet(blue color) | Thin peptidoglycan wall, does not trap crystal violet, retain coutnerstain(pink color) |
| No periplasmic space                                       | Contains periplasmic space                                                             |
| No porin proteins                                          | Contains porin proteins                                                                |
| Primarily produces exotoxins                               |                                                                                        |
