1. Introduction - History and Subject

Microbiology is the study of microbes
        ->Microbes are living organisms
        ->Require visualization through microscopy
Microbes are divided into :
        ->Viruses
                ->Classification:
                        -RNA or DNA
                        -Double stranded or single stranded(positive or negative sense for single stranded)
        Bacteria
                -Classification:
                        -Gram positive or Gream negative
                        -Shape(e.g cocci, bacillus)
        Fungi :
                -Classification:
                        -Yeast(unicellular)
                        -Mold(multicellular)
                        -Dimorphic(yeast and mold)
        Parasites :
                -Classification :
                        ->Protozoa
                        ->Worms(Helminths)
                        ->Bugs(Arthropods)

History :
    ->Primitive cells evolved into bacteria and archae(Prokaryotes)
    ->Utilized photosynthesis, which led to production of oxygen
    ->As oxygen levels rose, organisms that utilized oxygen evolved(Aerobes and Eukaryotes)
    ->Anaerobes developed resistance to oxygen, as it was toxic to them
    ->Endosymbiotic theory:
        ->A prokaryotic cell engulfed an aerobe cell, capable of producing ATP
        ->Host cell provided a stable environment, engulfed cell provided host cell with ATP, this lead to a symbiotic relationship
        ->The bacterium eventually evolved to mitochondrion (Prokaryotes -> Eukaryotes)


2. Bacterial Taxonomy - Classification, Nomeclature, Identification

-Hierarchy of Taxonomy rank(Established by Linnaues, Swedish botanist)
    ->Species
    ->Genus
    ->Family
    ->Order
    ->Class
    ->Family
    ->Division
    ->Kingdom

Taxonomy
    ->Refers to Classification, Nomeclature and Identification
    ->Classification is based upon :
        ->Size
        ->Shape(e.g cocci or bacilus)
        ->Arrangement(e.g in clusters or chains)
        ->Growth properties(e.g aerobe or anaerobe)
    Nomeclature :

        ->The first word(Genus) is always capitalized
        ->The second word(Species) is not capitalized
        e.g Staphylococcus(Genus) Aureus(Species)
    Identification :
        ->Practical use of classification

        -Results :
            ->Gram positive :
                ->Thick peptidoglycan wall that traps crystal violet ->
                ->violet-blue appearance
                ->No periplasmic space
                ->No porin proteins
                ->Primarily produces exotoxins
                ->Contains Teichnoic acids

        Nucleoid:
            Bacterial DNA, typically single standed and circular
            No histones
            DNA does not form nucleosomes
        Plasmid:
            Smaller genetic structures that can replicate independently
            Typically contain antibiotic resistance genes
        Cytoplasmic inclusions:
            -Metachromatic granules, serve as nutrient substance
        Ribosomes
            Composed of RNA and proteins which comprise of 2 subunits(Large-50s and Small 30s)
        Flagella
            Ropelike propellers that provide motility
        Pili
            Aids in adherance or promotes exchange of of bacterial chromosomes/Plasmids
        Spores
            Some gram positive bacteria can form spores when nutrients are limited(e.g Clostridia)
            Spores lack metabolic activity and are highly resistant to heat and chemicals
            Core contains dipicolinic acid(heat resistance)
            Must autoclave to kill spores by steaming at 121C for 15 minutes
            Hydrogen peroxide and iodine based agents are also sporocidal

5. Bacterial ultrastructure - cell wall, structure and biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall, Bacterial exceptions in the cell wall structure:

->Cell wall
    -Thick in gram positives, thin in gram negatives
    -Composition:
        ->Peptidohlycan is composed of:
            ->Mycolic acid in acid-fast bacteria
            ->Peptide side chains which are crosslinked transpeptidases
            ->Muramic acid: An alternating amino sugar acid
            ->Gram positives organisms have lipoteichoic acids
        ->Function:
            ->Net-like function
            ->Provides structural strength
            ->Protects against osmotic pressure damage
            ->Lipoteichoic acid stimulates release of TNA-a, IL-1
            ->Mycolic acid provides chemical and aridity resistance

->Biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall - Peptidoglycan synthesis
    ->Constructed on the surface of the cell membrane and is composed of repeating carbohydrate backbone subunit(NAG-NAM)
    ->Peptidoglycan biosyntehsis occurs via the following steps:
        ->Activation of carbohydrate subunits
            ->NAM and NAG subunits are activated by attachment to UDP
        ->Synthesis of the linking peptide
            ->A pentapeptide is added to UDP-NAM, with the two terminal alanine residues added as dipeptide
        ->Transfer of the peptidoglycan unit to bacroprenol phosphate
            ->NAP-PEP moiety is transferred from the UDP carrier to bacroprenol phosphate(BPP), located on the inner surface of the cell membrane
            ->UDP-NAG transfers NAG to NAP-PEP, completing the pepridoglycan repeat unit,
            ->NAG-NAM-PEP which is now attached to carrier BPP
        ->Addition of the repeat unit to the existing peptidoglycan
            ->BPP carries the NAG-NAM-PEP repeat unit to the outside surface, where the peptidoglycan of the existing cell wall is located
            ->Repeat unit is added to a free end, increasing length by one repeat unit
            ->Free ends are created by a limited hydrolytic loosening of the preexisting peptidoglycan
        ->Cross-linking of the pentapeptide to the peptidoglycan backbone :
            ->Cross linking is brought about by a transpeptidation reaction that bonds DAP of the peptide in an adjacent chain, causing the release of the terminal ala. This mode of direct cross-linking is characteristic of E coli and other gram negatives
            ->In G+, a glycine pentapeptide is usually interposed between the lysine at position three of one PEP and the ala at position four of the PEP
        ->Peptidoglycan biosynthesis is a target of antibacterial agents
            ->e.g Beta-Lactams such as penicilin inhibit the enzymes that catalyze transpeptidation and carboxypeptidation reactions of cell wall assembly

->Bacterial exceptions in cell wall
    -Mycoplasmas
        ->No cell wall, incorporate sterols
