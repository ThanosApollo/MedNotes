* 1. Introduction - History and Subject

** Microbiology is the study of microbes ff
- Microbes are the living organisms
- Require visualization through microscopy
    - Microbes are divided into :
        - Viruses
        - RNA or DNA
        - Double stranded or single stranded
    - Bacteria
        - Gram positive or gram negative
        - Shape(e.g cocci, bacillus)
    - Fungi
        - yeast(unicellular)
        - mold(multicellular)
        - dimorphic(yeast and mold)
    - Parasites
        - Protozoa
        - Worms
        - Bugs
- History
    - Primitive cells evolved into bacteria and archae
    - Utilized photosynthesis which led to production of oxygen
    - As oxygen levels rose, organisms that utilized oxygen evolved(Aerobes and Eukaryotes)
    - Anaerobes developed resistance to oxygen, as it was toxic to them
    - Endosymbiotic theory
        - A prokaryotic cell engulfed an aerobe cell, capable of producing ATP
        - Host cell provided a stable environment, engulfed cell provided host cell with ATP, this lead to a *symbiotic relationship*
        - The bacterium eventually evolved mitochondria - Prokaryotes -> Eukaryotes
   
  
* 2. Bacterial Taxonomy - Classification, Nomeclatures, Identification
*** Hierarchy of Taxonomy
1. Species
2. Genus
3. Order
4. Class
5. Family
6. Division
7. Kingdom
There are two kingdoms, *Plants or Animals*
- Taxonomy
    - Refers to classification, nomeclature and identifcation
- Classification is based upon:
    - Size
    - Shape(e.g cocci or bacilus)
    - Arrangement(e.g in clusters on in chains)
    - Growth properties(e.g aerobe or anaerobe)
- Nomeclatures
    - Governed by international rules
    - The first word(Genus) is always capitalized
    - The second word(Species) is not capitalized
    /e.g Staphylococcus Aureus/
- Identification
    - Practical use of classification
    - We use identification properties to identify casuative agents of a disease
    - Methods :
      - Cellular Morphology
      - Staining characteristics
      - Motility
      - Growth characteristics
      - Genetic analysis
* 3. Bacterial Morphology
- Bacteria are prokaryotes; no true nucleus or membrane bound organelles
*** Common shapes of bacteria :
- Cocci(Spherical) e.g Staphylococcus
- Bacili(Rods) e.g Clostridium
