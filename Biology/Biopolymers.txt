1. Origin and evolution of cells.

2. Proteins. Protein domains. Protein families.
Protein functions :
    ->Structural support
    ->Movement
    ->Catalysis
    ->Recognition
    ->Homeostasis
    Traits of an organism are determined by the proteins it can produce
Protein structure :
    -Primary structure :
        ->The sequence of the polypeptide chain
        ->Number of amino acids
3. Nucleic acids. DNA. RNA

4. Recognition and self-assembly of macromolecules. Cytoskeleton.

5. Transcription.

6. RNA processing.

7. Genetic code. Translation.

8. Proteins after translation: sorting, folding, modifications, degradation.

9. DNA replication.

10. RNA replication. Reverse transcription

11. DNA repair.
