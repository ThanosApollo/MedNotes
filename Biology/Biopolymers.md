### Protein functions :<br>
* Structural 
* Movement
* Catalysis
* Recognition
* Homeostasis
> Traits of an organism are determined by the proteins it can produce
### Protein structure :

* Primary structure :
    * The sequence of the polypeptide chain
        * Number of amino acids
        * Order of amino acids(arrangement)
> Primary structure is determined by the respective gene. Based on peptide bonds between amino acids.

> Ultimately determines all other levels of protein structure plus the function of the protein

* Secondary Structure 
    * Localized conformation of the polypeptide chain based 
        * Polypeptide backbone forms shapes entirely dependent on how to best store energy, by adapting the lowest energy conformation 
        * These shapes inclue :
            * Alpha helix 
                * e.g found in myoglobin
            * Beta-sheet 
                * e.g found in immunoglobins
* Tertiary Structure 
    * Complete Folding pattern, specific to its protein as it gives its function 
    * Factors that influence tertiary structure : 
        * hydrophobic residues in the interior 
        * hydrophilic residues on the exterior
        * Disulfide bonds help maintain structural integrity 
            * if a protein is highly compact we would call it a globular protein
            * if its long and "spinldy" we would call it a fibrous protein
* Quaternary Structure 
    * The way mutliple polypeptide subunits come together to form a larger protein
        * e.g the way the 4 haemoglobin subunits come together

> Primary : Sequence of residues
> Secondary : Localized folding 
> Tertiary : Complete folding pattern
> Quaternary : Interactions of subunits
