### Protein functions :<br>
* Structural 
* Movement
* Catalysis
* Recognition
* Homeostasis
> Traits of an organism are determined by the proteins it can produce
### Protein structure :

* Primary structure :
    * The sequence of the polypeptide chain
        * Number of amino acids
        * Order of amino acids(arrangement)
> Primary structure is determined by the respective gene. Based on peptide bonds between amino acids.

> Ultimately determines all other levels of protein structure plus the function of the protein

* Secondary Structure 
    * [ ] Localized conformation of the polypeptide chain based 
        * Polypeptide backbone forms shapes entirely dependent on how to best store energy, by adapting the lowest energy conformation 
        * These shapes inclue :
            * Alpha helix 
                * e.g found in myoglobin
            * Beta-sheet 
                * e.g found in immunoglobins
* Tertiary Structure 
    * Complete Folding pattern, specific to its protein as it gives its function 
    * Factors that influence tertiary structure : 
        * hydrophobic residues in the interior 
        * hydrophilic residues on the exterior
        * Disulfide bonds help maintain structural integrity 
            * if a protein is highly compact we would call it a globular protein
            * if its long and "spinldy" we would call it a fibrous protein
* Quaternary Structure 
    * The way mutliple polypeptide subunits come together to form a larger protein
        * e.g the way the 4 haemoglobin subunits come together

> Primary : Sequence of residues
> Secondary : Localized folding 
> Tertiary : Complete folding pattern
> Quaternary : Interactions of subunits 

* Protein domains 
    * Tertiary structure packs the alpha helices and/or beta sheets in globular units called **domains**
    * Some proteins have a single domain while others have two or more 
    * Different domains have different structure and perform different functions 
    * Popular folding patterns are called **protein motifs** 
* Protein Families 
    * A group of evolutionarily-related proteins
    * Share a corresponding gene family, leading to significant sequence similarity
    * Similar three-dimensional structures 
    * Can be groped into larger clades called protein super families 
        * e.g Immunoglobulin superfamily - contain a sandwich-like structure of two B-sheets
# 3. Nucleic acids. DNA. RNA 

### Nucleic Acids
> Long Linear chains of nucleotides linked by phosphodiester bonds, forming a backbone
* Nucleic acids are macromolecules responsible for storage, transmission and retrieval of genetic information
* Two types of nucleic acids ***DNA-Deoxyribonucleic*** acid and ***RNA-Ribonucleic*** acid

#### Structure 
* Polymers of nucleotides
* Each nucleotide consists of 
    * Nitrogenous base
    * Pentose
    * At least one phosphate group
    > DNA has A,T,C,G and deoxyribose
    > RNA has A,U,C,G and ribose
#### Formation 
* Nitrogenous base binds to the 1' atom of the pentose -> forms nucleoside
* Phosphate reacts with the 5' hydroxyl group of the pentose -> forms nucleotide
    * such nucleotides are called monophosphates
    * one or more phosphates may join the first one, forming nucleoside diphosphate, triphosphate etc. 
### Nucleic chain
* Nucleic acids are composed of nucleic chains, same as proteins are composed of polypeptide chains
* To form a polynucleotide the phosphate at the 5' atom of a pentose reacts with the 3' hydroxyl group of another pentose
  * creating a covalent bond 
* The alternating phosphates and pentoses form a backbone
  * Their arrangement determines the **primary structure** of the nucleic acid
### Complementarity 
* Nitrogenous bases bind specifically by hydrogen bonds according to the complementary rule
  * A with T or U(2 bonds), C with G(3 bonds)
* Complementary binding defines the secondary structure of nucleic acids

### The double helix and base stacking 
* Nitrogenous bases are **hydrophobic**(minimize their contact with water)
* When two complementary strands bind, their bases stack together like cards to **exclude water molecules**
  * This forces the backbones to bend spirally, **forming a double-stranded helix**

> To visualize nucleic acids we use cytochemical stains, e.g propidium iodide
