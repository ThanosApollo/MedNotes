# 2. Proteins. Protein domains. Protein families. 

### Protein functions :<br>
* Structural 
* Movement
* Catalysis
* Recognition
* Homeostasis
> Traits of an organism are determined by the proteins it can produce
### Protein structure :

* Primary structure :
    * The sequence of the polypeptide chain
        * Number of amino acids
        * Order of amino acids(arrangement)
> Primary structure is determined by the respective gene. Based on peptide bonds between amino acids.

> Ultimately determines all other levels of protein structure plus the function of the protein

* Secondary Structure 
    * Localized conformation of the polypeptide chain based 
        * Polypeptide backbone forms shapes entirely dependent on how to best store energy, by adapting the lowest energy conformation 
        * These shapes inclue :
            * Alpha helix 
                * e.g found in myoglobin
            * Beta-sheet 
                * e.g found in immunoglobins
* Tertiary Structure 
    * Complete Folding pattern, specific to its protein as it gives its function 
    * Factors that influence tertiary structure : 
        * hydrophobic residues in the interior 
        * hydrophilic residues on the exterior
        * Disulfide bonds help maintain structural integrity 
            * [ ] if a protein is highly compact we would call it a globular protein
            * if its long and "spinldy" we would call it a fibrous protein
* Quaternary Structure 
    * The way mutliple polypeptide subunits come together to form a larger protein
        * e.g the way the 4 haemoglobin subunits come together

> Primary : Sequence of residues
> Secondary : Localized folding 
> Tertiary : Complete folding pattern
> Quaternary : Interactions of subunits 

* Protein domains 
    * Tertiary structure packs the alpha helices and/or beta sheets in globular units called **domains**
    * Some proteins have a single domain while others have two or more 
    * Different domains have different structure and perform different functions 
    * Popular folding patterns are called **protein motifs** 
* Protein Families 
    * A group of evolutionarily-related proteins
    * Share a corresponding gene family, leading to significant sequence similarity
    * Similar three-dimensional structures 
    * Can be groped into larger clades called protein super families 
        * e.g Immunoglobulin superfamily - contain a sandwich-like structure of two B-sheets
# 3. Nucleic acids. DNA. RNA 

### Nucleic Acids
> Long Linear chains of nucleotides linked by phosphodiester bonds, forming a backbone
* Nucleic acids are macromolecules responsible for storage, transmission and retrieval of genetic information
* Two types of nucleic acids ***DNA-Deoxyribonucleic*** acid and ***RNA-Ribonucleic*** acid

#### Structure 
* Polymers of nucleotides
* Each nucleotide consists of 
    * Nitrogenous base 
    * Pentose
    * At least one phosphate group
    > DNA has A,T,C,G and deoxyribose
    > RNA has A,U,C,G and ribose
#### Formation 
* Nitrogenous base binds to the 1' atom of the pentose -> forms nucleoside
* Phosphate reacts with the 5' hydroxyl group of the pentose -> forms nucleotide * such nucleotides are called monophosphates * one or more phosphates may join the first one, forming nucleoside diphosphate, triphosphate etc. ### Nucleic chain * Nucleic acids are composed of nucleic chains, same as proteins are composed of polypeptide chains
* To form a polynucleotide the phosphate at the 5' atom of a pentose reacts with the 3' hydroxyl group of another pentose
  * creating a covalent bond 
* The alternating phosphates and pentoses form a backbone
  * Their arrangement determines the **primary structure** of the nucleic acid
#### Complementarity 
* Nitrogenous bases bind specifically by hydrogen bonds according to the complementary rule
  * A with T or U(2 bonds), C with G(3 bonds)
* Complementary binding defines the secondary structure of nucleic acids

#### The double helix and base stacking 
* Nitrogenous bases are **hydrophobic**(minimize their contact with water)
* When two complementary strands bind, their bases stack together like cards to **exclude water molecules**
  * This forces the backbones to bend spirally, **forming a double-stranded helix**

> To visualize nucleic acids we use cytochemical stains, e.g propidium iodide
#### DNA - helix types and functions
> There are three types of double helices: A,B and Z
* **B DNA**
  * The main helix type of DNA
  * Right handed
  * 10 nucleotide per turn
  * 2 grooves, one minor and one major
* **A DNA**
  * Dehydrated form of DNA
  * Similar to B DNA, but with **larger diameter**
* **Z DNA**
  * Z DNA is named so because its **backbone forms a zig-zag**
  * Formed in small parts of DNA, mainly CGCGCG sequence
#### DNA sense
* To identify DNA strands, they are scored as the 'sense' and 'antisense'
  * **Sense strand** - Positive : coding strand 
  * **Antisense** - Negative : Template strand, complementary to both positive sense and the RNA transcript 
  > The term sense and anti-sense are relative only to particular RNA transcript, and not to the DNA strand as a whole
  > There are viruses, such as Arenaviruses, that are ambisense 
### RNA structure 
> RNA molecules are linear molecules, much smaller than DNA
* Single stranded
  * Often has double-stranded parts called stem-loops/hairpin loops
* Secondary Structure is determined by **loops**
* RNA undergoes 3D folding as in proteins, called tertiary structure
  * Both secondary and tertiary are based on primary structure 
* Some RNAs have catalytic activity, they are called **ribozymes**

#### RNA - types and functions 
##### RNAs involved in transcription or replication 
* mRNA - Messenger RNA : Encodes amino acid sequence of a polypeptide
* tRNA - Transfer RNA : Brings amino acids to ribosomes during translation 
* rRNA - Ribosomal RNA : Makes up the ribosomes, with ribosomal proteins

* **mRNA**
  * no remarkable spacial structure 
  * each mRNA is a copy of a gene encoding protein, and brings the "message" to ribosomes
  * The coding region of mRNA consists of nucleotide triplets called codons which are recognized by the tRNA anticodons
  * The first codon(AUG) is called the start codon, while the last codon is called the last stop codon 
* **rRNA**
  * Engaged in hairpin loops
  * Structural role - formation of ribosomal subunits 
    * The largest rRNA is a ribozyme 
* **tRNA**
  * Small 
  * 4 loops, 3 large and one small
  * **Secondary structure** resembles a leaf
  * **Tertiary structure** resembles L-like shape 
  * tRNA function is to match amino acids according to mRNA instructions

  
# 4. Recognition and self-assembly of macromolecules. Cytoskeleton.
### Self-assembly of macromolecules
* Ability of macromolecules to recognize each other and specifically bind spontaneously, forming supermolecular structures
  * The recognition is based on spatial affinity, we can compare to a lock-key mechanism
    * Self-assembled complexes are held together by non-covalent bonds
* Complementary recognition and bidning of nucleotides **allows replication and transcription**, the basis of life 
* Heating above 70C causes denaturation of DNA - seperation of the two strands
  * but this process is reversible, when the solution is cooled cown, DNA strands find their complementary partners and pair by hydrogen bonds
    * this process is called annealing
  * if the paired strands are derived from one and the **same molecule**, the annealing is called **renaturation or reassociation**.
  * if the pairned strands are derived from **different DNA molecules**, the annealing is called **hybridization**
  * RNAs also hybridize

### Cytoskeleton 
#### Types - Ranked by size 
  * Microfilaments 
    * Helix appearing as made up of 2 protofilaments 
    * Consist of Actin(globular protein)
  * Intermediate filaments 
    * Bundle of tetramers made of dimers 
    * Fibrous proteins(keratins in epithelial, desmin in muscle)
  * Microtubules 
    * Hollow tube of 13 protofilaments made of AB-tubulin dimers
* The cytoskeleton includes all of those types. Intermediate filaments are characteristic of animals(not in plants)

#### Microtubules
* Self-assemble from dimers composed of alpha and beta tubulin. Energy from GTP is used
* Microtubules are hollow tubes *with a diameter of 25nm*
* Microtubule is **composed of 13 protofilaments**
* Eventhough some microtubules e.g in flagella are very stable, microtubules in cytoplasm have a property called dynamic instability
  * It means that their + end grows by addition of tubulin dimer but occasionally collapses
  * Dynamic instability is regulated, it is increased when the cell starts division

#### Microfilament composition, assembly and polarity 
* Microfilaments are assembled from actin using ATP energy. The single soluble actin molecules are called **globular (G-) actin** while those included in microfilaments are called **fibrillar (F-) actin**
* Acting molecules are arranged in a double helix
  * The microfilament can be described as a single helix
* Microfilaments **grow just one of their ends**, its called '+' while the other one is '-'

##### Myosins 
* Microfilaments responsible for transport of membrane organelles, as well as movement and shape changes
* Motor proteins, called myosins use **ATP to move to the '+' end**
* Has a **head** with ATPase activity and along fibrous **tail**
> Myosin is unusual in that it is both a fibrous protein and an enzyme(ATPase)

#### Intermediate filaments 
* Size less than microtubules and bigger than microfilaments 
* **Fibrous proteins with the 'coiled coil' motif**
* Provide mechanical support, **not fit for transport because they have NO POLARITY**
* Common types :
  * Lamins 
    * located in the nucleus, also called **Nuclear lamina**
  * keratins in epithelial 
  * desmin in muscles 
  * neurofilament proteins in neurons

# 5. Transcription.
> RNA synthesis using a particular DNA segment as a template 
* The template DNA and synthesised RNA are antiparallel
  * RNA synthesis direction is 5'-3'
